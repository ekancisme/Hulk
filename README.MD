‚ùó WHAT IS A DDoS ATTACK?

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks flood a target (website/server) with traffic from multiple sources, overwhelming its capacity and making it unavailable to real users.

Types of DDoS Attacks:

1. Application Layer Attacks:
   - Repeated HTTP requests to overload server-side processing.
   - Example: HTTP flood using multiple fake IPs.

2. Protocol Attacks:
   - Exhaust server or firewall resources using malformed packets.
   - Example: SYN Flood ‚Äì overwhelms TCP handshakes.

3. Volumetric Attacks:
   - Overload bandwidth using amplified traffic.
   - Example: DNS Amplification.

------------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è DDoS THREATS:

- Botnets controlled remotely to coordinate mass attacks.
- Tools originally designed for testing are being misused by attackers.
- Even small-scale "stresser" tools can cripple major websites if used in combination.

------------------------------------------
üö® CHALLENGES WITH DDoS ATTACKS:

- DNS floods, cloud-targeted attacks, and bandwidth exhaustion.
- Attacks that slow services without taking them offline can evade detection.
- IoT devices are increasing points of vulnerability.
- Organizations are often targeted repeatedly once found vulnerable.

------------------------------------------
‚ùì WHY DO DDoS ATTACKS HAPPEN?

- üí∞ Ransom: Demands made before or after attacks.
- üó£Ô∏è Hacktivism: To express support/opposition toward a cause.
- üíº Business Rivalry: Competitors may target each other.

------------------------------------------
üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Real-time packet filtering and analysis
- Deploy a DDoS Defense System (DDS)
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Apply rate-limiting rules to control traffic
