WHAT IS A DDoS ATTACK?

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):
An attack where multiple systems flood a server with traffic,
causing it to crash or become unavailable to users.

------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF DDoS ATTACKS:

1. Application Layer Attacks:
   - Flood the server with HTTP or web-based requests.

2. Protocol Attacks:
   - Exploit networking protocols (e.g., SYN flood).

3. Volumetric Attacks:
   - Overwhelm server bandwidth (e.g., DNS amplification).

------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVES BEHIND DDoS ATTACKS:

- Ransom (financial extortion)
- Hacktivism (political or social motives)
- Business Competition (disrupt rival services)

------------------------------------------------------------
PREVENTION STRATEGIES:

- Real-time packet filtering
- DDoS Defense Systems (DDS)
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Request rate limiting
